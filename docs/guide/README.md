# Overview

This Node RED module gets the events from an ical-URL, a caldav-server or from iCloud.

There are three types of nodes:
- [upcoming](./upcoming.md) - a list of events
- [sensors](./sensors.md) - check if a event is running currently
- [trigger](./trigger.md) - trigger a output on event start and event end
